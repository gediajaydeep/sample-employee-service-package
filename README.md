# Employee Management System

This repository hosts the **Employee Service**, a specialized Dart/Flutter module designed to handle robust employee data management, automated tax calculations (TDS), and SQLite persistence.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **[`employee_service`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./employee_service/README.md)**: The standalone package containing all business logic, database schemas, and payroll processing engines.

## 🛠 Key Capabilities

The `employee_service` package provides the following out-of-the-box features:

* **Automated Payroll Logic**: Built-in logic for calculating Net Salary based on regional tax rates (e.g., India at 10%, USA at 12%).
* **Persistent Storage**: Full SQLite integration with automated database initialization and data seeding.
* **Flexible Filtering**: Advanced querying capabilities to filter employees by name, role, or country.
* **Dynamic Updates**: Smart repository logic that only updates modified fields, preserving existing database integrity.
* **Global Analytics**: Real-time aggregate metrics including average, minimum, and maximum salary statistics.

## 🤖 AI Collaboration

This project demonstrates a high-fidelity collaboration between the developer and **Gemini (AI)**.

The developer architected the system, defined the strict business rules, and managed the project lifecycle. Gemini was utilized to generate precise SQL queries, accelerate model boilerplate creation, and ensure comprehensive test coverage through automated test generation.
